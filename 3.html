<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"target="_blank" title="JavaScript Specification">JavaScript</a>,
  often abbreviated as JS,
is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side
for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated
JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

  JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

<p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O),
such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser
or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>

<p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core
components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</p>

<p>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries,
the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
