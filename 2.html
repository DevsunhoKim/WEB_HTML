<h2>CSS</h2>

  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html"target="_blank" title="CSS Specification">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language</a> used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML
     (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
<img src="cssjp.jpg" width="100%">
  <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
    This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
    characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
    which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to
    improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

  <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
    for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice
    (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate
     formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>

  <p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies
    if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>

  <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type)
    text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for
    CSS documents.</p>

  <p>In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>
